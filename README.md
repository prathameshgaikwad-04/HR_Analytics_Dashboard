📊 HR Analytics Dashboard – Attrition Analysis (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition patterns using Power BI to help HR stakeholders understand what is happening, why it is happening, and which employee segments are at higher risk of attrition.

The dashboard transforms raw HR data into actionable insights by combining data cleaning, modeling, DAX measures, and interactive visualizations.

🎯 Business Objectives

Measure overall employee attrition and attrition rate

Identify high-risk departments, roles, and demographics

Analyze key drivers of attrition such as salary, tenure, and experience

Enable interactive, slice-and-dice analysis for decision-makers

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Microsoft Power BI

Power Query (Data cleaning & transformation)

DAX (Measures & calculations)

Dataset: HR Employee Attrition dataset (CSV)

Purpose

Identify root causes of attrition and highlight high-risk employee segments for targeted retention strategies.

📊 Key Insights

Attrition rate is approximately 16%, indicating moderate workforce churn

Lower salary bands experience significantly higher attrition

New hires (0–1 years) and early-career employees show the highest attrition rates

Attrition is concentrated in specific job roles such as Sales Executive and Laboratory Technician

Gender does not appear to be a primary driver of attrition

🧠 Business Conclusion

Attrition is primarily driven by compensation levels, early tenure, limited experience, and role-specific pressures, rather than demographic factors.
Targeted retention strategies focused on new hires, early-career employees, low-salary bands, and high-risk roles would likely yield the greatest impact.
